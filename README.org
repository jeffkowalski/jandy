* Installation
1. clone the git repo
2. install required gems

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
bundle install
#+END_SRC

* Configuration
Build a ~/.credentials/iaqualink.yaml file with contents similar to

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ruby ./jandy.rb describe-status --no-log --verbose
---
:username: 'your username'
:password: 'your password'
:location: 'location of pool, as shown in iAquaLink website'
:serial_number:   'four hyphen-separated triples, like DAR-2VR-A7N-JR2'
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Running
Normally, you'll want to run with the log turned off, and perhaps increased verbosity.
The _describe-status_ command shows helpful information about the pool:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results replace raw
ruby ./jandy.rb describe-status --no-log --verbose
#+END_SRC

Which will yield something similar to the following:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
I, [2018-06-30T20:37:59.003455 #26076]  INFO -- : starting
The pool temperature is unknown.
The air temperature is 74 degrees.
The filter pump is off.
The solar panels are off.
#+END_EXAMPLE
